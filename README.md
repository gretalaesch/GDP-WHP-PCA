# STAT346 Final Project
Countries around the world are annually ranked by their gross domestic product (GDP) as well as by population happiness. Though one would expect economic strength to be in line with general happiness, often, an individual country’s two rankings do not equal each other. We set out to explore what factors could contribute to what we call a country’s “ranking differential,” or what social, economic, or political metrics could be linked to a country either overperforming or underperforming in its expected happiness. Using primarily linear regression in conjunction with supplementary methods like principal component analysis and stepwise regression, we find that the most influential predictors affecting the wealth-happiness differential often vary by the economic status of a country; after creating subgroups based on income, these significant factors include rates of life, death, and access to clean resources.
